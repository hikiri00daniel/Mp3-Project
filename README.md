# Mp3-Project

This is my final project for my Embedded Systems course at San Jose State University.

For this project, I collaborated with a fellow student, Lawrence Wan, and we designed a Mp3 player from scratch.

The goal of the project is to design device drivers to interface the SJOne microcontroller to a Mp3 decoder to create a Mp3 Player.


Components we used:

Vs1053 MP3 Dev Board


SJOne Board


2x16 LCD w/ IÂ²C backpack


6 push button/switch


Breadboard


## Code Breakdown:


Daniel: Decoder


Lawrence: LCD screen


Together: Interfacing and testing the final product
